                            <p> I see psychotherapy as an extremely underutilised resource in the lives of individuals.
                                Often people feel that therapy is only an option once they have burnout, hit rock bottom or
                                when they are no longer able to deny their private struggles. Having worked in the private
                                outpatient and inpatient setting in Johannesburg I have noticed how many people do not see
                                therapy as an option. As life gets busier and the demands placed on them only increase,
                                individuals seem to be more willing to sacrifice self-care before anything else. Therapy,
                                mental health and basic self-care are often seen as indulgent rather than vitally important
                                in these difficult times. The more that we feel overwhelmed, isolated and pressured, the
                                more we seem to withdraw into ourselves. This often creates an echo chamber of
                                self-defeating beliefs and maladaptive internalised patterns of behaviour, which were often
                                developed in our childhood. This tends to impact our ability to experience a value-based
                                life in which one can engage in love, work and play. </p>

                        <p> As a psychologist I am constantly amazed by peoplesâ€™ resilience and capacity to
                            overcome tremendous hardship. I feel privileged when clients confide and share
                            that which is deeply painful and feel honoured to embark on the therapeutic
                            journey with them. </p>
                        <p>I have managed the Dual Diagnosis Unit at Akeso Parktown for several years and in
                            addition manage the COPE therapy team compromising of several psychologists
                            and occupational therapists. Alongside this I run my own private practice. I believe in
                            using the Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) model with my clients in order to
                            empower and equip individuals in managing overwhelming feelings in productive
                            ways. I put effort into creating a non-judgemnetal thinking space that allows clients
                            to find themselves.</p>
                        <p>Having practiced for the last nine years, I have come to value the significance of a
                            team approach and derive great fulfilment working in conjunction with a team of
                            committed and dedicated people.</p>

                        <p> I am a registered counselling psychologist who believes wholeheartedly in the
                            power of psychology and the potential for healing that a safe, non-judgemental
                            therapy relationship can create. I am also aware that starting therapy can feel very
                            scary and so I aim to create a space where your voice can be heard in a meaningful
                            way, in a manner that you are comfortable with. I have extensive experience working
                            with adolescents, adults, and families using Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT)
                            skills as a way to help clients gain insight and learn to manage their lives more
                            effectively. I have trained in Psychodynamic, Dialectical Behavioural, Narrative
                            Sandtray, Expressive Arts, Schema and family therapies. I view therapy as a manner
                            in which to make sense of, and put life experiences into perspective so that you are
                            no longer held hostage by your past</p>

                        <p class="tp_edu">MA Counselling Psychology (WITS), BSc. Hons Psychology (UCT)
                            BA. Psychology (WITS)</p>
                        <p> I acquired my Psychology Honours Degree at the University of Cape Town. I then
                            completed my Masters in Community Based Counselling Psychology at the
                            University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Part of my Masters training
                            required that I complete an internship, which I completed in two different hospital
                            sites (â€˜Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospitalâ€™ and â€˜Helen Joseph Hospitalâ€™).
                            After my internship I immediately began my private practice, and later began
                            working at Akeso Clinic in Parktown. In my work experience I have treated
                            adolescents, adults, couples and families. I also have more than 5 yearsâ€™ worth of
                            running group psychotherapy sessions.
                            Furthermore, in my private capacity I have done a number of mental health-related
                            workshops. To date I have run the following kinds of workshops:</p>

                        <h3>Clinical Psychologist</h3>
                        <p class="tp_edu">MA Clinical Psychology (WITS), BA. Hons Psychology (WITS)
                            BA. Psychology (WITS)</p>
                        <p> While the step towards engaging in a therapeutic process is an immensely
                            courageous one, it can also be a daunting and anxiety provoking one. My aim is thus
                            to provide a non-judgemental, safe and caring environment where your thoughts
                            and experiences can be fully expressed. </p>
                        <p>As a registered Clinical Psychologist, my experience ranges from treating everyday
                            problems to more serious mental health difficulties. While my therapy approach is
                            to use an integrated model to suit my clientâ€™s needs, I enjoy working from an Insight
                            Oriented (Psychodynamic) approach which facilitates a deeper understanding of
                            oneself through making links between past and present experiences, thoughts,
                            beliefs and emotions. Furthermore, I also enjoy making use of the Dialectical
                            Behaviour Therapy (DBT) approach in further assisting my clients with managing
                            overwhelming emotions in a more productive manner</p>
                        <p>I have experience working in both the Public and Private sectors. I completed both
                            my internship and community service years in the public sector working at Charlotte
                            Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic
                            Hospital and Helen Joseph Hospital respectively. Following on from this I began my
                            private practice as well as working at Akeso Clinic in Parktown. My work included
                            individual therapy with children, adolescents and adults, couples and family
                            therapy, and the facilitation of groups in both an inpatient and outpatient setting.
                            Furthermore, I have conducted various psychological assessments</p>
