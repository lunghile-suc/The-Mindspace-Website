                        <div class="tp_description">
                            <p> I see psychotherapy as an extremely underutilised resource in the lives of
                                individuals. Often people feel that therapy is only an option once they have burnout,
                                hit rock bottom or when they are no longer able to deny their private struggles.
                                Having worked in the private outpatient and inpatient setting in Johannesburg I have
                                noticed how many people do not see therapy as an option. As life gets busier and the
                                demands placed on them only increase, individuals seem to be more willing to
                                sacrifice self-care before anything else. Therapy, mental health and basic self-care
                                are often seen as indulgent rather than vitally important in these difficult times. The
                                more that we feel overwhelmed, isolated and pressured, the more we seem to
                                withdraw into ourselves. This often creates an echo chamber of self-defeating beliefs
                                and maladaptive internalised patterns of behaviour, which were often developed in
                                our childhood. This tends to impact our ability to experience a value-based life in
                                which one can engage in love, work and play.
                            </p>
                            <p>Psychotherapy allows the individual a space to explore the internal working of their
                                mind in a judgement free supportive environment. The ability to look at yourself and
                                build a compassionate relationship with your own mind is a radical action, and while
                                very difficult at times, can prove massively beneficial. I offer both in-person and
                                online sessions.</p>

                                that which is deeply painful. It is an honour to embark on a therapeutic journey with
                                with my clients.

                                into the personal struggles that individuals face on a daily basis as well as the level
                                of investment that is required in order to manage and overcome some of these
                                struggles.</p>
                            <p>I believe in using a combination of insight oriented therapy in conjunction with
                                Dialectical Behavior therapy (DBT). This facilitates an understanding of how our past
                                impacts on our present, but it also serves to empower and equip individuals in
                                managing overwhelming feelings in productive ways. I prioritise creating a
                                non-judgemental thinking space in the hope that it will enable clients to find
                                themselves and attempt to establish meaning amidst uncertainty.
                            </p>
                            <p>Having practiced for over a decade, I have come to value the significance
                                of a team approach and derive great fulfilment working in conjunction with a team
                                of committed and dedicated people.

                            <p> I am a registered counselling psychologist who believes wholeheartedly in the power
                                of psychology and the potential for healing that a safe, non-judgemental therapy
                                relationship can create. I am also aware that starting therapy can feel very scary and
                                so I aim to create a space where your voice can be heard in a meaningful way, in a
                                manner that you are comfortable with. I view therapy as a manner in which to make
                                sense of, and put life experiences into perspective so that you are no longer held
                                hostage by your past.</p>

                                I enjoy using Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) skills as a way to help clients
                                gain insight and learn to manage their lives more effectively.
                                I have also trained in Psychodynamic, Dialectical Behavioural, Narrative, Sandtray,

                            <p> I acquired my Psychology Honours Degree at the University of Cape Town. I then

                                University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Part of my Masters training
                                required that I complete an internship, which I completed in two different hospital
                                sites (â€˜Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospitalâ€™ and â€˜Helen Joseph Hospitalâ€™).
                                After my internship I immediately began my private practice, and later began working
                                at Akeso Clinic in Parktown. In my work experience I have treated adolescents,
                                adults, couples and families. I also have more than 5 yearsâ€™ worth of running group
                                psychotherapy sessions.
                                Furthermore, in my private capacity I have done a number of mental health-related

                                courageous one, it can also be a daunting and anxiety provoking one. My aim is thus
                                to provide a non-judgemental, safe and caring environment where your thoughts and

                                use an integrated model to suit my clientâ€™s needs, I enjoy working from an Insight
                                Oriented (Psychodynamic) approach which facilitates a deeper understanding of
                                oneself through making links between past and present experiences, thoughts,
                                beliefs and emotions. Furthermore, I also enjoy making use of the Dialectical

                            <p>I have experience working in both the Public and Private sectors. I completed both

                                Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic
                                Hospital and Helen Joseph Hospital respectively. Following on from this I began my
                                private practice as well as working at Akeso Clinic in Parktown. My work included
                                individual therapy with children, adolescents and adults, couples and family therapy,
                                and the facilitation of groups in both an inpatient and outpatient setting. Furthermore,
